# Collatz Prime Chains

A research project exploring rare prime number sequences (Generalized Cunningham Chains) generated by the increasing step of the Collatz conjecture map:

    f(x) = (3x + 1) / 2

## Overview

While the Collatz conjecture suggests that all positive integers eventually converge to 1, certain local dynamics allow for the generation of prime number sequences that "diverge" or increase for several steps under the map f(x) = (3x + 1) / 2 while maintaining primality.

This repository documents the discovery of a **length-7 prime chain** starting from x = 89599.

## The Chain

The following sequence consists of 7 consecutive primes where each term is generated by applying f(x) = (3x + 1) / 2 to the previous one:

1. 89,599  
2. 134,399  
3. 201,599  
4. 302,399  
5. 453,599  
6. 680,399  
7. 1,020,599

The sequence terminates at x₇ = 1,530,899, which is a composite number (divisible by 41).

## Mathematical Insights

### The "99" Invariance

All terms in this chain end in **"99"**. This is explained by the modular congruence:

    x ≡ -1 mod 200

Starting with x₀ ≡ 199 mod 200 ensures that subsequent terms remain in a specific residue class that avoids small prime factors like 2 and 5. This property helps sustain the chain for more iterations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `sympy` library for fast primality testing

### Installation

Install the required library using pip:

    pip install sympy

### Usage

Run the search script to verify the known chain or explore higher ranges:

    python collatz_chain_finder.py

You can also modify the script to search for longer chains or apply additional filters.
